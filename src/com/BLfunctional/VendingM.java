/*Desc -> There is 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 Rs Notes which can
 *  be returned by Vending Machine. Write a Program to calculate the minimum
 *   number of Notes as well as the Notes to be returned by the Vending
 *    Machine as a Change
I/P -> read the Change in Rs to be returned by the Vending Machine
Logic -> Use Recursion and check for largest value of the Note to
